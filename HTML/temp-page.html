           Maximum daily temperature data supports the general hypothesis that temperatures increase as you approach the equator. Additionally, the southern hemisphere is shown to be altogether warmer than the northern hemisphere. This is expected, and at least in part due to the locations of the habitable landmasses within the southern hemisphere.<br/> <br/> It should be noted that island cities and coastal cities are heavily selected for in the dataset. Since our city locator chooses cities by matching known locations to pins randomly dropped anywhere in the globe, one can imagine that the pins dropped in the ocean all get directed to islands and coastlines. Also, the weather of the southern hemisphere is less represented by this data than the weather of the northern hemisphere. That may be because there is much less settled land in the southern hemisphere.
